# Portfolio

This repository is a place to show off pieces of work that I spent time working on and am at least somewhat proud of. Most of these pieces were created as part of school projects, or simply because I wanted to try something all on my own. My major projects are all located in their own repositories on my main page!

## Flower Shop

The final sprint project for Semester 2 of the Software Development program. We had to create a storefront in the form of a React App. This was my first time implementing any sort of log in/log out authentication.

## Game

A high or low card game I created to function on a static page. I wanted to experiment with DOM and CSS. This was good practice for my school work!

## Challenge Week 1

Literally my first coding project (that wasn't as simple as a calculator). I created this in my first Semester for "Challenge Week" - an opportunity for students to show off their home projects. It is a simple text adventure! I look back on this and realize how far I've come.

## Sprint Week 2

The final project for Semester 3. A full stack web application, built in React. Takes advantage of a custom back-end and uses both Mongo and PostgreSQL! I enjoyed this project for all of the practice it provided. Implementing the search function and learning about Atlas was quite exciting.
